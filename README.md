# Cache Cleaner

This script is designed to help you clean up cache files in a specified directory and its subdirectories. It recursively deletes all files within each subdirectory, allowing you to quickly empty cache folders.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
  
## Usage

`chmod +x empty_caches.sh`

`./empty_caches.sh`


Please exercise caution when using the `rm` command, as it permanently deletes files. Make sure the specified directory is the intended cache folder and that you have a backup of any important files before running the script.
